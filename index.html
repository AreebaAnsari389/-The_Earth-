    <h2>Potential For Life</h2>
    <p>Earth has a very hospitable temperature and mix of chemicals that have made life abundant here. 
        Most notably, Earth is unique in that most of our planet is covered in liquid water, since the 
        temperature allows liquid water to exist for extended periods of time. Earth's vast oceans provided 
        a convenient place for life to begin about 3.8 billion years ago.

        Some of the features of our planet that make it great for sustaining life are changing due to the
         ongoing effects of climate change.</p>
